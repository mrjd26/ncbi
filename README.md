playing around with javascript fetch async await promise etc. with The National Center for Biotechnology Information  JS apis


I really disagree with the nomenclature in certain recent JavaScript features/rewrites

fetch is what a dog does.  

request, get - these terms already in use are more descriptive and ... already being used by, oh, HTTP.


Promise ?


wtf. are we all 13 year old girls now. 

who named this stuff ?
